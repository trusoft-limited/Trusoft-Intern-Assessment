Project background
Olowo Media is a merchandise printing company based in Lagos, Nigeria.  The company makes custom T-shirts, apparel & promotional products online with the highest quality printing & customer service. Products are ordered in person or by phone and delivered through reputable logistic companies across Nigeria. 
Project:
The company has decided to take advantage of the post-pandemic digital work to provide a print-on-demand service as an additional source of revenue.
Print on demand would enable a service where customers can order products such as t-shirts, mugs etc in smaller quantities and the products are not printed until an order is made.
order has been received, allowing them to be printed singly, or in small quantities.
The directors have agreed the need to undertake the following projects:
1. Website - An e-commerce website to enable clients customize templated designs with text and graphic, select items to print on from a catalogue, provide a cost and order one or more quantities
2. Integrate - An integration project to connect the e-commerce website to their order-management and fulfilment application through APIs to automate processing and delivery
3. Platform - A print on demand platform to offer printing, order fulfilment, and shipping for a brand / user’s online store. It would allow users to print one-of-a-kind designs for products through their online shop.
The CEO has authorised the projects. Your role would be to manage the delivery of one of the projects reporting to the senior project manager.
